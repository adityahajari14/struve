        "description": "Over the last 40 years, Mr. Najjar has undertaken several roles in the Civil/Structural engineering industry, from design to project management to representing mega project developers like Aldar and Red Sea Global. Throughout this period, he has designed and overseen the construction of a wide range of structures, from mixed use developments to public buildings to heavy industrial buildings and shoreline structures.\nMr. Najjar has noticed during this period that a lot of waste is taking place in large developments and has done an extensive study on the mechanisms resulting in this waste and the means of its prevention. Since the largest percentage, by far, of the materials being wasted is concrete, this waste delivers a direct boost to the carbon footprint of the projects. So, the idea of StruVE was born, with a dual win initiative: save money and save the planet at the same time."
